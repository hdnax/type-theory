Hands-on implementations of type systems, interpreters, and related concepts. Includes exercises from TAPL, PLAI, Software Foundations, and other sources.

## Setup

This project uses [Nix](https://nixos.org/) for reproducible development environments.

### Prerequisites

- [Nix](https://nixos.org/download/) with flakes enabled

### Getting Started

```bash
# Enter the development shell
nix develop

# Or use direnv for automatic activation
echo "use flake" > .envrc && direnv allow
```

The dev shell provides:
- **OCaml** — compiler, dune, utop, ocaml-lsp, ocamlformat
- **Racket** — includes DrRacket
- **Coq** — compiler and IDE support
